=head1 NAME

  SQL::Functional::Clause - Represents a portion of an SQL string

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Moose role for representing SQL strings.

=head1 PROVIDED MOOSE TYPES

=head2 SQL::Functional::Type::Literals

An array ref of C<SQL::Functional::LiteralClause> objects.  It will 
automatically coerce any strings in the array to C<PlacheolderClause>s.

=head2 SQL::Functional::Type::Clauses

An array ref of C<SQL::Functional::Clause> objects. It will automatically 
coerce any strings in the array to C<PlaceholderClause>s.

=head1 PROVIDED ATTRIBUTES

=head2 params

Type C<SQL::Functional::Type::Clauses>. These represent the parameters of 
your clause.  Has C<auto_deref> set, so you can say:

  my @params = $obj->params;

Also see C<get_params()> for a method that can potentially fetch the params 
of subclauses recursively.

=head1 PROVIDED METHODS

=head1 get_params

As of version 0.3, this will recurse into calling C<params> on subclauses by 
default. It can be overriden to get only C<params> if need be.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 to_string

Returns the SQL string that represents this clause.
